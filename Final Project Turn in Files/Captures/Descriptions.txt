STARTUP:

	This is how the program looks as it is started up. The text boxes are empty.

ABOUT:

	After the 'about' menu is selected, the about text is output to the console text box.	

LOCAL FILE LOADED:

	After the 'File->Load File...' menu item is selected, the user is prompted with a file selection
	dialog (They may only select csv files). If the user selects a valid file, it will be read in
	and the filepath displayed upon completion in the 'local:' textbox. If an error occurs during read,
	the error will be outputted to the console.

VERIFICATION RESULT:

	After the 'File->Verify...' menu item is selected, the user is prompted with a file selection dialog.
	This menu item is only accessible after a local file has been loaded. Once the user selects a valid
	"remote" file, the remote file is loaded in as a remote schedule and if there are no errors,
	The local and remote files are verified. Any errors during verification are output to the console.
	Otherwise, a success message is printed.

CLEAR:

	The user has selected the 'Clear' Button in the top-right. This clears the filepath text boxes
	and removes the loaded schedules from memory.

RELOAD BUTTON:
	
	Reloads the local and remote schedules using the filepaths shown in the textboxes, provided they
	are still valid files. Once they have both been successfully read in again, the two will be 
	verified again and the output of the verification process outputted to the console.
