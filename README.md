# CIS-501 Homework Repository
This repository is here so that my partner and I can work together, in-person or remotely, on our assigned homework.

## How To Contribute

1. Clone the repository to a desired location on your PC
    * If using a terminal, type `git clone https://github.com/Afulton11/CIS-501-HW.git`

2. Checkout to the current homework's branch
    * i.e for homework 1, the branch is: `hw1-object-storage`
      * To checkout using a terminal first do `git fetch` to fetch the latest files, commits, and branches, then do `git checkout <branch-name>` to switch to the desired branch.
      * I recommend using a git GUI over the terminal, here are the following git-GUI's I use:
        * For Windows -> [GitExtensions](https://gitextensions.github.io/)
        * For macOS/Linux/Windows -> [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)

3. Pull the repository.
    * If using the terminal, type `git pull`
       
4. You can now edit/create files for the homework

5. Once you have made a few commits, or are ready to push, dont forget to stage the files!
    * To stage files in a terminal, type `git add <file-name>`
      * To check which files still need to be staged, use `git status`

6. Push your changes to the repository.
    * If using a terminal, type `git push origin` or `git push origin <branch-name>`

**Note:** I will add you to the list of contributors for the current homework's branch, once I know *your GitHub username*. If I don't have your Github username, or I have forgotton to add you to the list of contributors for the branch, then you will not be able to push your changes.
